# 3D Printing HDD Stackable Mounts

When I started out building my FreeNAS server, I wanted to get it up and running
with hardware that I had, well before looking at a proper Rackmount chasis with
Hotswap bays and SGPIO backplane etc.

The tricky part was [figuring out a way to get all the drives to sit inside my
Corsair Air 740
case](http://mwdesilva.com/posts/til-setting-up-my-freenas-11-xeon-server).

My solution was to design and 3D print brackets that were optimised to be
cost-effective, and modular, allowing to stack 3.5" HDDs without any limit on
the total stack size.

Given the design, orientation is also configurable to either mount the drives
vertically &mdash; and using the included base-plate &mdash; or in a typical
caddy style setup.

Mounting holes are 3.2mm
